abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has transformed our understanding of the
  human brain through well-replicated mapping of abilities to specific structures
  (for example, lesion studies) and functions1–3 (for example, task functional MRI
  (fMRI)). Mental health research and care have yet to realize similar advances from
  MRI. A primary challenge has been replicating associations between inter-individual
  differences in brain structure or function and complex cognitive or mental health
  phenotypes (brain-wide association studies (BWAS)). Such BWAS have typically relied
  on sample sizes appropriate for classical brain mapping4 (the median neuroimaging
  study sample size is about 25), but potentially too small for capturing reproducible
  brain–behavioural phenotype associations5,6. Here we used three of the largest neuroimaging
  datasets currently available—with a total sample size of around 50,000 individuals—to
  quantify BWAS effect sizes and reproducibility as a function of sample size. BWAS
  associations were smaller than previously thought, resulting in statistically underpowered
  studies, inflated effect sizes and replication failures at typical sample sizes.
  As sample sizes grew into the thousands, replication rates began to improve and
  effect size inflation decreased. More robust BWAS effects were detected for functional
  MRI (versus structural), cognitive tests (versus mental health questionnaires) and
  multivariate methods (versus univariate). Smaller than expected brain–phenotype
  associations and variability across population subsamples can explain widespread
  BWAS replication failures. In contrast to non-BWAS approaches with larger effects
  (for example, lesions, interventions and within-person), BWAS reproducibility requires
  samples with thousands of individuals.
