abstract: Abstract  The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) established community
  consensus on the organization of data and metadata for several neuroimaging modalities.
  Traditionally, BIDS had a strong focus on functional magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) datasets and lacked guidance on how to store multimodal structural MRI datasets.
  Here, we present and describe the BIDS Extension Proposal 001 (BEP001), which adds
  a range of quantitative MRI (qMRI) applications to the BIDS. In general, the aim
  of qMRI is to characterize brain microstructure by quantifying the physical MR parameters
  of the tissue via computational, biophysical models. By proposing this new standard,
  we envision standardization of qMRI through multicenter dissemination of interoperable
  datasets. This way, BIDS can act as a catalyst of convergence between qMRI methods
  development and application-driven neuroimaging studies that can help develop quantitative
  biomarkers for neural tissue characterization. In conclusion, this BIDS extension
  offers a common ground for developers to exchange novel imaging data and tools,
  reducing the entrance barrier for qMRI in the field of neuroimaging.
