Functional neuroimaging is an essential tool for neuroscience research. Pre-processing pipelines produce standardized, minimally pre-processed data to support a range of potential analyses. However, post-processing is not similarly standardized. While several options for post-processing exist, they may not support output from different pre-processing pipelines, may have limited documentation, and may not follow generally accepted data organization standards (e.g. BIDS). In response, we present XCP-D: a collaborative effort between PennLINC at the University of Pennsylvania and the DCAN lab at the University of Minnesota. XCP-D uses an open development model on GitHub and incorporates continuous integration testing; it is distributed as a Docker container or Apptainer image. XCP-D generates denoised BOLD images and functional derivatives from resting-state data in either NIfTI or CIFTI files following pre-processing with fMRIPrep, HCP, or ABCD-BIDS pipelines. Even prior to its official release, XCP-D has been downloaded &gt;5,000 times from DockerHub. Together, XCP-D facilitates robust, scalable, and reproducible post-processing of fMRI data.},
