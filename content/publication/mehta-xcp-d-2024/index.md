abstract: 'Abstract Functional neuroimaging is an essential tool for neuroscience
  research. Pre-processing pipelines produce standardized, minimally pre-processed
  data to support a range of potential analyses. However, post-processing is not similarly
  standardized. While several options for post-processing exist, they may not support
  output from different pre-processing pipelines, may have limited documentation,
  and may not follow generally accepted data organization standards (e.g. BIDS). In
  response, we present XCP-D: a collaborative effort between PennLINC at the University
  of Pennsylvania and the DCAN lab at the University of Minnesota. XCP-D uses an open
  development model on GitHub and incorporates continuous integration testing; it
  is distributed as a Docker container or Apptainer image. XCP-D generates denoised
  BOLD images and functional derivatives from resting-state data in either NIfTI or
  CIFTI files following pre-processing with fMRIPrep, HCP, or ABCD-BIDS pipelines.
  Even prior to its official release, XCP-D has been downloaded &gt;5,000 times from
  DockerHub. Together, XCP-D facilitates robust, scalable, and reproducible post-processing
  of fMRI data.'
