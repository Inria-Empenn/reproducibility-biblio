abstract: Abstract This study tackles the Garden of Forking Paths, as a challenge
  for replicability and reproducibility of ERP studies. Here, we applied a multiverse
  analysis to a sample ERP N400 dataset, donated by an independent research team.
  We analyzed this dataset using 14 pipelines selected to showcase the full range
  of methodological variability found in the N400 literature using systematic review
  approach. The selected pipelines were compared in depth by looking into statistical
  test outcomes, descriptive statistics, effect size, data quality, and statistical
  power. In this way we provide a worked example of how analytic flexibility can impact
  results in research fields with high dimensionality such as ERP, when analyzed using
  standard null‐hypothesis significance testing. Out of the methodological decisions
  that were varied, high‐pass filter cut‐off, artifact removal method, baseline duration,
  reference, measurement latency and locations, and amplitude measure (peak vs. mean)
  were all shown to affect at least some of the study outcome measures. Low‐pass filtering
  was the only step which did not notably influence any of these measures. This study
  shows that even some of the seemingly minor procedural deviations can influence
  the conclusions of an ERP study. We demonstrate the power of multiverse analysis
  in both identifying the most reliable effects in a given study, and for providing
  insights into consequences of methodological decisions. ,  This study shows that
  most ERP preprocessing and analysis steps can affect study outcomes, and that even
  some of the seemingly minor procedural deviations can influence conclusions of an
  ERP study, and it demonstrates the power of the multiverse analysis approach in
  both identifying the most reliable effects and providing concrete insights into
  consequences of a given methodological decision.
