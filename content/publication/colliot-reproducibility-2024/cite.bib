 abstract = {Medical image computing (MIC) is devoted to computational methods for analysis of medical imaging data and their assessment through experiments. It is thus an experimental science. Reproducibility is a cornerstone of progress in all experimental sciences. As in many other fields, there are major concerns that reproducibility is unsatisfactory in MIC. However, reproducibility is not a single concept but a spectrum, which is often misunderstood by researchers. Moreover, even though some measures have been put in place to promote reproducibility in the MIC community, it is unclear if they have been effective so far.},
