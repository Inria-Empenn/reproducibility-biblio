abstract: Limited statistical power due to small sample sizes is a problem in fMRI
  research. Most of the work to date has examined the impact of sample size on task‐related
  activation, with less attention paid to the influence of sample size on brain‐behavior
  correlations, especially in actual experimental fMRI data. We addressed this issue
  using two large data sets (a working memory task, N = 171, and a relational processing
  task, N = 865) and both univariate and multivariate approaches to voxel‐wise correlations.
  We created subsamples of different sizes and calculated correlations between task‐related
  activity at each voxel and task performance. Across both data sets the magnitude
  of the brain‐behavior correlations decreased and similarity across spatial maps
  increased with larger sample sizes. The multivariate technique identified more extensive
  correlated areas and more similarity across spatial maps, suggesting that a multivariate
  approach would provide a consistent advantage over univariate approaches in the
  stability of brain‐behavior correlations. In addition, the multivariate analyses
  showed that a sample size of roughly 80 or more participants would be needed for
  stable estimates of correlation magnitude in these data sets. Importantly, a number
  of additional factors would likely influence the choice of sample size for assessing
  such correlations in any given experiment, including the cognitive task of interest
  and the amount of data collected per participant. Our results provide novel experimental
  evidence in two independent data sets that the sample size commonly used in fMRI
  studies of 20–30 participants is very unlikely to be sufficient for obtaining reproducible
  brain‐behavior correlations, regardless of analytic approach., Limited statistical
