abstract: 'Abstract Efficiency of evidence accumulation (EEA), an individual’s ability
  to selectively gather goal-relevant information to make adaptive choices, is thought
  to be a key neurocomputational mechanism associated with cognitive functioning and
  transdiagnostic risk for psychopathology. However, the neural basis of individual
  differences in EEA is poorly understood, especially regarding the role of largescale
  brain network dynamics. We leverage data from 5198 participants from the Human Connectome
  Project and Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study to demonstrate a strong
  association between EEA and flexible adaptation to cognitive demand in the “task-positive”
  frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks. Notably, individuals with higher EEA
  displayed divergent task-positive network activation across n-back task conditions:
  higher activation under high cognitive demand (2-back) and lower activation under
  low demand (0-back). These findings suggest that brain networks’ flexible adaptation
  to cognitive demands is a key neural underpinning of EEA.'
