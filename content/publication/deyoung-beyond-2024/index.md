abstract: 'Linking neurobiology to relatively stable individual differences in cognition,
  emotion, motivation, and behavior can require large sample sizes to yield replicable
  results. Given the nature of between-person research, sample sizes at least in the
  hundreds are likely to be necessary in most neuroimaging studies of individual differences,
  regardless of whether they are investigating the whole brain or more focal hypotheses.
  However, the appropriate sample size depends on the expected effect size. Therefore,
  we propose four strategies to increase effect sizes in neuroimaging research, which
  may help to enable the detection of replicable between-person effects in samples
  in the hundreds rather than the thousands: (1) theoretical matching between neuroimaging
  tasks and behavioral constructs of interest; (2) increasing the reliability of both
  neural and psychological measurement; (3) individualization of measures for each
  participant; and (4) using multivariate approaches with cross-validation instead
  of univariate approaches. We discuss challenges associated with these methods and
  highlight strategies for improvements that will help the field to move toward a
  more robust and accessible neuroscience of individual differences.'
