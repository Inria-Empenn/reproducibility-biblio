abstract: This document explores the advantages of integrating open source software
  and practices in managing a scientific lab, emphasizing reproducibility and the
  avoidance of pitfalls. It details practical applications from website management
  using GitHub Pages to organizing datasets in compliance with BIDS standards, highlights
  the importance of continuous testing for data integrity, IT management through Ansible
  for efficient system configuration, open source software development. The broader
  goal is to promote transparent, reproducible science by adopting open source tools.
  This approach not only saves time but exposes students to best practices, enhancing
  the transparency and reproducibility of scientific research.
