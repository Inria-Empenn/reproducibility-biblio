abstract: Collaborative networks and data sharing initiatives are broadening the opportunities
  for the advancement of science. These initiatives offer greater transparency in
  science, with the opportunity for external research groups to reproduce, replicate,
  and extend research findings. Further, larger datasets offer the opportunity to
  identify homogeneous patterns within subgroups of individuals, where these patterns
  may be obscured by the heterogeneity of the neurobiological measure in smaller samples.
  However, data sharing and data pooling initiatives are not without their challenges,
  especially with new laws that may at first glance appear quite restrictive for open
  science initiatives. Interestingly, what is key to some of these new laws (i.e,
  the European Union's general data protection regulation) is that they provide greater
  control of data to those who “give” their data for research purposes. Thus, the
  most important element in data sharing is allowing the participants to make informed
  decisions about how they want their data to be used, and, within the law of the
  specific country, to follow the participants' wishes. This framework encompasses
  obtaining thorough informed consent and allowing the participant to determine the
  extent that they want their data shared, many of the ethical and legal obstacles
  are reduced to just monsters under the bed. In this manuscript we discuss the many
  options and obstacles for data sharing, from fully open, to federated learning,
  to fully closed. Importantly, we highlight the intersection of data sharing, privacy,
  and data ownership and highlight specific examples that we believe are informative
  to the neuroimaging community.
