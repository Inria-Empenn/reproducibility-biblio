abstract: Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful tool for
  studying brain function, but neuroimaging research produces ongoing concerns regarding
  small-sample studies and how to interpret them. Although it is well understood that
  larger samples are preferable, many situations require researchers to make judgments
  from small studies, including reviewing the existing literature, analyzing pilot
  data, or assessing subsamples. Quantitative guidance on how to make these judgments
  remains scarce. To address this, we leverage the Human Connectome Project's Young
  Adult dataset to survey various analyses--from regional activation maps to predictive
  models. We find that, for some classic analyses such as detecting regional activation
  or cluster peak location, studies with as few as 40 subjects are adequate, although
  this depends crucially on effect sizes. For predictive modeling, similar sizes can
  be adequate for detecting whether features are predictable, but at least an order
  of magnitude more (at least hundreds) may be required for developing consistent
  predictions. These results offer valuable insights for designing and interpreting
  fMRI studies, emphasizing the importance of considering effect size, sample size,
  and analysis approach when assessing the reliability of findings. We hope that this
  survey serves as a reference for identifying which kinds of research questions can
  be reliably answered with small-scale studies.
