abstract: A lab handbook is a flexible document that outlines the ethos of a research
  lab or group. A good handbook will outline the different roles within the lab, explain
  what is expected of all lab members, provide an overview of the culture the lab
  aims to create, and describe how the lab supports its members so that they can develop
  as researchers. Here we describe how we wrote a lab handbook for a large research
  group, and provide resources to help other labs write their own handbooks.
