abstract: Abstract Functional magnetic resonance imaging in rodents holds great potential
  for advancing our understanding of brain networks. Unlike the human community, there
  remains no standardized resource in rodents for image processing, analysis and quality
  control, posing significant reproducibility limitations. Our software platform,
  Rodent Automated Bold Improvement of EPI Sequences, is a pipeline designed to address
  these limitations for preprocessing, quality control, and confound correction, along
  with best practices for reproducibility and transparency. We demonstrate the robustness
  of the preprocessing workflow by validating performance across multiple acquisition
  sites and both mouse and rat data. Building upon a thorough investigation into data
  quality metrics across acquisition sites, we introduce guidelines for the quality
  control of network analysis and offer recommendations for addressing issues. Taken
  together, this software platform will allow the emerging community to adopt reproducible
  practices and foster progress in translational neuroscience.
