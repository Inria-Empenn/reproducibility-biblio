abstract: Abstract  When different researchers study the same research question using
  the same dataset they may obtain different and potentially even conflicting results.
  This is because there is often substantial flexibility in researchers’ analytical
  choices, an issue also referred to as “researcher degrees of freedom”. Combined
  with selective reporting of the smallest p -value or largest effect, researcher
  degrees of freedom may lead to an increased rate of false positive and overoptimistic
  results. In this paper, we address this issue by formalizing the multiplicity of
  analysis strategies as a multiple testing problem. As the test statistics of different
  analysis strategies are usually highly dependent, a naive approach such as the Bonferroni
  correction is inappropriate because it leads to an unacceptable loss of power. Instead,
  we propose using the “minP” adjustment method, which takes potential test dependencies
  into account and approximates the underlying null distribution of the minimal p
  -value through a permutation-based procedure. This procedure is known to achieve
  more power than simpler approaches while ensuring a weak control of the family-wise
  error rate. We illustrate our approach for addressing researcher degrees of freedom
  by applying it to a study on the impact of perioperative   $$paO_2$$   p a  O 2      on
  post-operative complications after neurosurgery. A total of 48 analysis strategies
  are considered and adjusted using the minP procedure. This approach allows to selectively
  report the result of the analysis strategy yielding the most convincing evidence,
  while controlling the type 1 error—and thus the risk of publishing false positive
  results that may not be replicable.
