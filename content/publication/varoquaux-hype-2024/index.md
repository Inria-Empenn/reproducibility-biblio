abstract: "With the growing attention and investment in recent AI approaches such
  as large language models, the narrative that the larger the AI system the more valuable,
  powerful and interesting it is is increasingly seen as common sense. But what is
  this assumption based on, and how are we measuring value, power, and performance?
  And what are the collateral consequences of this race to ever-increasing scale?
  Here, we scrutinize the current scaling trends and trade-offs across multiple axes
  and refute two common assumptions underlying the 'bigger-is-better' AI paradigm:
  1) that improved performance is a product of increased scale, and 2) that all interesting
  problems addressed by AI require large-scale models. Rather, we argue that this
  approach is not only fragile scientifically, but comes with undesirable consequences.
  First, it is not sustainable, as its compute demands increase faster than model
  performance, leading to unreasonable economic requirements and a disproportionate
  environmental footprint. Second, it implies focusing on certain problems at the
  expense of others, leaving aside important applications, e.g. health, education,
  or the climate. Finally, it exacerbates a concentration of power, which centralizes
  decision-making in the hands of a few actors while threatening to disempower others
  in the context of shaping both AI research and its applications throughout society."
