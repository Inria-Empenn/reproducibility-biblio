 abstract = {Finding an interpretable and compact representation of complex neuroimaging data is extremely useful for understanding brain behavioral mapping and hence for explaining the biological underpinnings of mental disorders. However, hand-crafted representations, as well as linear transformations, may inadequately capture the considerable variability across individuals. Here, we implemented a data-driven approach using a three-dimensional autoencoder on two large-scale datasets. This approach provides a latent representation of high-dimensional task-fMRI data which can account for demographic characteristics whilst also being readily interpretable both in the latent space learned by the autoencoder and in the original voxel space. This was achieved by addressing a joint optimization problem that simultaneously reconstructs the data and predicts clinical or demographic variables. We then applied normative modeling to the latent variables to define summary statistics (‘latent indices’) and establish a multivariate mapping to non-imaging measures. Our model, trained with multi-task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and UK biobank task-fMRI data, demonstrated high performance in age and sex predictions and successfully captured complex behavioral characteristics while preserving individual variability through a latent representation. Our model also performed competitively with respect to various baseline models including several variants of principal components analysis, independent components analysis and classical regions of interest, both in terms of reconstruction accuracy and strength of association with behavioral variables.},
