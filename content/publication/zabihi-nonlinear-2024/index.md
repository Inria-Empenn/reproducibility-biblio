abstract: Finding an interpretable and compact representation of complex neuroimaging
  data is extremely useful for understanding brain behavioral mapping and hence for
  explaining the biological underpinnings of mental disorders. However, hand-crafted
  representations, as well as linear transformations, may inadequately capture the
  considerable variability across individuals. Here, we implemented a data-driven
  approach using a three-dimensional autoencoder on two large-scale datasets. This
  approach provides a latent representation of high-dimensional task-fMRI data which
  can account for demographic characteristics whilst also being readily interpretable
  both in the latent space learned by the autoencoder and in the original voxel space.
  This was achieved by addressing a joint optimization problem that simultaneously
  reconstructs the data and predicts clinical or demographic variables. We then applied
  normative modeling to the latent variables to define summary statistics (‘latent
  indices’) and establish a multivariate mapping to non-imaging measures. Our model,
  trained with multi-task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and UK
  biobank task-fMRI data, demonstrated high performance in age and sex predictions
  and successfully captured complex behavioral characteristics while preserving individual
  variability through a latent representation. Our model also performed competitively
  with respect to various baseline models including several variants of principal
  components analysis, independent components analysis and classical regions of interest,
  both in terms of reconstruction accuracy and strength of association with behavioral
  variables.
