Background
The development of machine learning models for aiding in the diagnosis of mental disorder is recognized as a significant breakthrough in the field of psychiatry. However, clinical practice of such models remains a challenge, with poor generalizability being a major limitation.


Methods

Here, we conducted a pre-registered meta-research assessment on neuroimaging-based models in the psychiatric literature, quantitatively examining global and regional sampling issues over recent decades, from a view that has been relatively underexplored. A total of 476 studies (
n
= 118,137) were included in the current assessment. Based on these findings, we built a comprehensive 5-star rating system to quantitatively evaluate the quality of existing machine learning models for psychiatric diagnoses.



Results

A global sampling inequality in these models was revealed quantitatively (sampling Gini coefficient (
G
) = 0.81,
p
\textless .01), varying across different countries (regions) (e.g., China,
G
= 0.47; the USA,
G
= 0.58; Germany,
G
= 0.78; the UK,
G
= 0.87). Furthermore, the severity of this sampling inequality was significantly predicted by national economic levels (

Further analyses showed that lack of independent testing (84.24% of models, 95% CI: 81.0–87.5%), improper cross-validation (51.68% of models, 95% CI: 47.2–56.2%), and poor technical transparency (87.8% of models, 95% CI: 84.9–90.8%)/availability (80.88% of models, 95% CI: 77.3–84.4%) are prevailing in current diagnostic classifiers despite improvements over time. Relating to these observations, model performances were found decreased in studies with independent cross-country sampling validations (all

Conclusions
Together, improving sampling economic equality and hence the quality of machine learning models may be a crucial facet to plausibly translating neuroimaging-based diagnostic classifiers into clinical practice.},
