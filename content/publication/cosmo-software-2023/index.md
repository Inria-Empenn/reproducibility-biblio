abstract: Software Heritage is the largest public archive of software source code
  and associated development history, as captured by modern version control systems.
  As of July 2023, it has archived more than 16 billion unique source code files coming
  from more than 250 million collaborative development projects. In this chapter,
  we describe the Software Heritage ecosystem, focusing on research and open science
  use cases.
