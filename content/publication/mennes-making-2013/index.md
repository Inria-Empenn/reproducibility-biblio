abstract: 'Over a decade ago, the fMRI Data Center (fMRIDC) pioneered open-access
  data sharing in the task-based functional neuroimaging community. Well ahead of
  its time, the fMRIDC effort encountered logistical, sociocultural and funding barriers
  that impeded the Ô¨Åeld-wise instantiation of open-access data sharing. In 2009, ambitions
  for open-access data sharing were revived in the resting state functional MRI community
  in the form of two grassroots initiatives: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project
  (FCP) and its successor, the International Neuroimaging Datasharing Initiative (INDI).
  Beyond providing open access to thousands of clinical and non-clinical imaging datasets,
  the FCP and INDI have demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale data aggregation
  for hypothesis generation and testing. Yet, the success of the FCP and INDI should
  not be confused with widespread embracement of open-access data sharing. Reminiscent
  of the challenges faced by fMRIDC, key controversies persist and include participant
  privacy, the role of informatics, and the logistical and cultural challenges of
  establishing an open science ethos. We discuss the FCP and INDI in the context of
  these challenges, highlighting the promise of current initiatives and suggesting
  solutions for possible pitfalls.'
