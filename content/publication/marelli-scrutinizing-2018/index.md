abstract: How will new decentralized governance impact research? ,   On 25 May 2018,
  the European Union (EU) regulation 2016/679 on data protection, also known as the
  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), will take effect. The GDPR, which repeals
  previous European legislation on data protection (Directive 95/46/EC) ( 1 ), is
  bound to have major effects on biomedical research and digital health technologies,
  in Europe and beyond, given the global reach of EU-based research and the prominence
  of international research networks requiring interoperability of standards. Here
  we describe ways in which the GDPR will become a critical tool to structure flexible
  governance for data protection. As a timely forecast for its potential impact, we
  analyze the implications of the GDPR in an ongoing paradigmatic legal controversy
  involving the database originally assembled by one of the world's first genomic
  biobanks, Shardna.
