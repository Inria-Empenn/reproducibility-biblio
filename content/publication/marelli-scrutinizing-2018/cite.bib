Here we describe ways in which the GDPR will become a critical tool to structure flexible governance for data protection. As a timely forecast for its potential impact, we analyze the implications of the GDPR in an ongoing paradigmatic legal controversy involving the database originally assembled by one of the world's first genomic biobanks, Shardna.},
