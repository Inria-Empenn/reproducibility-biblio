abstract: Efforts to replicate portions of the scientific literature have lead to
  widely varying and often low rates of replicability. This has raised concerns over
  a ``replication crisis'' whereby many of the statistically significant claims in
  the published literature are thought to be false positives, due to some combination
  of publication bias and widespread use of questionable research practices. Here,
  we re-analyze data from large-scale replication efforts and show that few, if any,
  replication failures can be attributed to false positives. We then present a minimal,
  alternative model of how replication failures can occur even in the absence of false
  positives. Using our model, we show that variation in estimates of replicability
  across social science appears largely to be an artifact of replication sample size.
  Our results further suggest that file-drawer sizes are likely much smaller, and
  Questionable Research Practices less abundant, than commonly assumed.  We anticipate
  our findings will be a starting point for more formal and nuanced discussion of
  the health of the scientific literature and areas for improvement.
