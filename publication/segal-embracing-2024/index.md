abstract: Despite decades of research, we lack objective diagnostic or prognostic
  biomarkers of mental health problems. A key reason for this limited progress is
  a reliance on the traditional case-control paradigm, which assumes that each disorder
  has a single cause that can be uncovered by comparing average phenotypic values
  of cases and control samples. Here, we discuss the problematic assumptions on which
  this paradigm is based and highlight recent efforts that seek to characterize, rather
  than minimize, the inherent clinical and biological variability that characterizes
  psychiatric populations. We argue that embracing such variability will be necessary
  to understand pathophysiological mechanisms and to develop more targeted and effective
  treatments.
