abstract: Abstract For most neuroimaging questions the range of possible analytic
  choices makes it unclear how to evaluate conclusions from any single analytic method.
  One possible way to address this issue is to evaluate all possible analyses using
  a multiverse approach, however, this can be computationally challenging and sequential
  analyses on the same data can compromise predictive power. Here, we establish how
  active learning on a low-dimensional space capturing the inter-relationships between
  pipelines can efficiently approximate the full spectrum of analyses. This approach
  balances the benefits of a multiverse analysis without incurring the cost on computational
  and predictive power. We illustrate this approach with two functional MRI datasets
  (predicting brain age and autism diagnosis) demonstrating how a multiverse of analyses
  can be efficiently navigated and mapped out using active learning. Furthermore,
  our presented approach not only identifies the subset of analysis techniques that
  are best able to predict age or classify individuals with autism spectrum disorder
  and healthy controls, but it also allows the relationships between analyses to be
  quantified.
