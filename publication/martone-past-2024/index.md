abstract: Neuroscience has made significant strides over the past decade in moving
  from a largely closed science characterized by anemic data sharing, to a largely
  open science where the amount of publicly available neuroscience data has increased
  dramatically. While this increase is driven in significant part by large prospective
  data sharing studies, we are starting to see increased sharing in the long tail
  of neuroscience data, driven no doubt by journal requirements and funder mandates.
  Concomitant with this shift to open is the increasing support of the FAIR data principles
  by neuroscience practices and infrastructure. FAIR is particularly critical for
  neuroscience with its multiplicity of data types, scales and model systems and the
  infrastructure that serves them. As envisioned from the early days of neuroinformatics,
  neuroscience is currently served by a globally distributed ecosystem of neuroscience-centric
  data repositories, largely specialized around data types. To make neuroscience data
  findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable requires the coordination across
  different stakeholders, including the researchers who produce the data, data repositories
  who make it available, the aggregators and indexers who field search engines across
  the data, and community organizations who help to coordinate efforts and develop
  the community standards critical to FAIR. The International Neuroinformatics Coordinating
  Facility has led efforts to move neuroscience toward FAIR, fielding several resources
  to help researchers and repositories achieve FAIR. In this perspective, I provide
  an overview of the components and practices required to achieve FAIR in neuroscience
  and provide thoughts on the past, present and future of FAIR infrastructure for
  neuroscience, from the laboratory to the search engine.
