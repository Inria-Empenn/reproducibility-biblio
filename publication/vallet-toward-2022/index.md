abstract: Abstract Reproducibility crisis urge scientists to promote transparency
  which allows peers to draw same conclusions after performing identical steps from
  hypothesis to results. Growing resources are developed to open the access to methods,
  data and source codes. Still, the computational environment, an interface between
  data and source code running analyses, is not addressed. Environments are usually
  described with software and library names associated with version labels or provided
  as an opaque container image. This is not enough to describe the complexity of the
  dependencies on which they rely to operate on. We describe this issue and illustrate
  how open tools like Guix can be used by any scientist to share their environment
  and allow peers to reproduce it. Some steps of research might not be fully reproducible,
  but at least, transparency for computation is technically addressable. These tools
  should be considered by scientists willing to promote transparency and open science.
