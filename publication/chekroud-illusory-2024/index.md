abstract: It is widely hoped that statistical models can improve decision-making related
  to medical treatments. Because of the cost and scarcity of medical outcomes data,
  this hope is typically based on investigators observing a model’s success in one
  or two datasets or clinical contexts. We scrutinized this optimism by examining
  how well a machine learning model performed across several independent clinical
  trials of antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia. Models predicted patient outcomes
  with high accuracy within the trial in which the model was developed but performed
  no better than chance when applied out-of-sample. Pooling data across trials to
  predict outcomes in the trial left out did not improve predictions. These results
  suggest that models predicting treatment outcomes in schizophrenia are highly context-dependent
  and may have limited generalizability. ,  Editor’s summary  A central promise of
  artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is that large datasets can be mined to
  predict and identify the best course of care for future patients. Unfortunately,
  we do not know how these models would perform on new patients because they are rarely
  tested prospectively on truly independent patient samples. Chekroud et al . showed
  that machine learning models routinely achieve perfect performance in one dataset
  even when that dataset is a large international multisite clinical trial (see the
  Perspective by Petzschner). However, when that exact model was tested in truly independent
  clinical trials, performance fell to chance levels. Even when building what should
  be a more robust model by aggregating across a group of similar multisite trials,
  subsequent predictive performance remained poor. —Peter Stern  ,  Clinical prediction
  models that work in one trial do not work in future trials of the same condition
  and same treatments.
