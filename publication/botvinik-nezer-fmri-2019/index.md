abstract: Abstract There is an ongoing debate about the replicability of neuroimaging
  research. It was suggested that one of the main reasons for the high rate of false
  positive results is the many degrees of freedom researchers have during data analysis.
  In the Neuroimaging Analysis Replication and Prediction Study (NARPS), we aim to
  provide the first scientific evidence on the variability of results across analysis
  teams in neuroscience. We collected fMRI data from 108 participants during two versions
  of the mixed gambles task, which is often used to study decision-making under risk.
  For each participant, the dataset includes an anatomical (T1 weighted) scan and
  fMRI as well as behavioral data from four runs of the task. The dataset is shared
  through OpenNeuro and is formatted according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure
  (BIDS) standard. Data pre-processed with fMRIprep and quality control reports are
  also publicly shared. This dataset can be used to study decision-making under risk
  and to test replicability and interpretability of previous results in the field.
