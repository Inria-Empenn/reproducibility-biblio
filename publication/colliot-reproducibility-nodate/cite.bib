 abstract = {Medical image computing (MIC) is devoted to computational methods for analysis of medical imaging data and their assessment through experiments. It is thus an experimental science. Reproducibility is a cornerstone of progress in all experimental sciences. As in many other fields, there are major concerns that reproducibility is unsatisfactory in MIC. However, reproducibility is not a single concept but a spectrum, which is often misunderstood by researchers. Moreover, even though some measures have been put in place to promote reproducibility in the MIC community, it is unclear if they have been effective so far.},
 annote = {Abstract
Reproducibility is a spectrum most of the time misunderstood as illustrated by the quantitative analysis of MICCAI reviews: in medical image computing some bad practices remains that should be corrected. Introduction
Reproducibility -\textgreater linked to a measure 
Reproducibility within medical imaging --\textgreater clinical results are the targetDIfferent types of reproducibility:


Exact reproducibility: identical results as those of a previously published paper Remark: what is the metric for that


Statistical reproducibility: reproduce results under statiscally equivalent conditionse.g. another sample for the same population


Conceptual reproducibility


Measurement reproducibility
