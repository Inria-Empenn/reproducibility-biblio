abstract: Medical image computing (MIC) is devoted to computational methods for analysis
  of medical imaging data and their assessment through experiments. It is thus an
  experimental science. Reproducibility is a cornerstone of progress in all experimental
  sciences. As in many other fields, there are major concerns that reproducibility
  is unsatisfactory in MIC. However, reproducibility is not a single concept but a
  spectrum, which is often misunderstood by researchers. Moreover, even though some
  measures have been put in place to promote reproducibility in the MIC community,
  it is unclear if they have been effective so far.
