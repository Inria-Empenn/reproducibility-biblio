reproducibility crisis in different fields of science, focus here  on neuroimaging reproducibility more precisely on reproducibility of  task fMRI based studies.
same data different analysis = robust
same data same analysis = reproducible
diffrent data same analysis = replicable
The “vibration of effects” (VoE)[2] describes the extent to which an estimated association changes under multiple distinct analytical modeling approaches --\textgreater variation of effect size found due to human intervention },
