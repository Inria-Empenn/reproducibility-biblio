abstract: Abstract Neuroimaging data analysis often requires purpose-built software,
  which can be challenging to install and may produce different results across computing
  environments. Beyond being a roadblock to neuroscientists, these issues of accessibility
  and portability can hamper the reproducibility of neuroimaging data analysis pipelines.
  Here, we introduce the Neurodesk platform, which harnesses software containers to
  support a comprehensive and growing suite of neuroimaging software (https://www.neurodesk.org/).
  Neurodesk includes a browser-accessible virtual desktop environment and a command
  line interface, mediating access to containerized neuroimaging software libraries
  on various computing platforms, including personal and high-performance computers,
  cloud computing and Jupyter Notebooks. This community-oriented, open-source platform
  enables a paradigm shift for neuroimaging data analysis, allowing for accessible,
  flexible, fully reproducible, and portable data analysis pipelines.
