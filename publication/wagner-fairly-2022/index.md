abstract: 'Abstract Large-scale datasets present unique opportunities to perform scientific
  investigations with unprecedented breadth. However, they also pose considerable
  challenges for the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability
  (FAIR) of research outcomes due to infrastructure limitations, data usage constraints,
  or software license restrictions. Here we introduce a DataLad-based, domain-agnostic
  framework suitable for reproducible data processing in compliance with open science
  mandates. The framework attempts to minimize platform idiosyncrasies and performance-related
  complexities. It affords the capture of machine-actionable computational provenance
  records that can be used to retrace and verify the origins of research outcomes,
  as well as be re-executed independent of the original computing infrastructure.
  We demonstrate the framework’s performance using two showcases: one highlighting
  data sharing and transparency (using the studyforrest.org dataset) and another highlighting
  scalability (using the largest public brain imaging dataset available: the UK Biobank
  dataset).'
