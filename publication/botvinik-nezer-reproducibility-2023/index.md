abstract: Recent years have marked a renaissance in efforts to increase research reproducibility
  in psychology, neuroscience, and related ﬁelds. Reproducibility is the cornerstone
  of a solid foundation of fundamental research—one that will support new theories
  built on valid ﬁndings and technological innovation that works. The increased focus
  on reproducibility has made the barriers to it increasingly apparent, along with
  the development of new tools and practices to overcome these barriers. Here, we
  review challenges, solutions, and emerging best practices with a particular emphasis
  on neuroimaging studies. We distinguish 3 main types of reproducibility, discussing
  each in turn. Analytical reproducibility is the ability to reproduce ﬁndings using
  the same data and methods. Replicability is the ability to ﬁnd an effect in new
  datasets, using the same or similar methods. Finally, robustness to analytical variability
  refers to the ability to identify a ﬁnding consistently across variation in methods.
  The incorporation of these tools and practices will result in more reproducible,
  replicable, and robust psychological and brain research and a stronger scientiﬁc
  foundation across ﬁelds of inquiry.
