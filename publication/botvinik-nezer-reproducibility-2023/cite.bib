 abstract = {Recent years have marked a renaissance in efforts to increase research reproducibility in psychology, neuroscience, and related ﬁelds. Reproducibility is the cornerstone of a solid foundation of fundamental research—one that will support new theories built on valid ﬁndings and technological innovation that works. The increased focus on reproducibility has made the barriers to it increasingly apparent, along with the development of new tools and practices to overcome these barriers. Here, we review challenges, solutions, and emerging best practices with a particular emphasis on neuroimaging studies. We distinguish 3 main types of reproducibility, discussing each in turn. Analytical reproducibility is the ability to reproduce ﬁndings using the same data and methods. Replicability is the ability to ﬁnd an effect in new datasets, using the same or similar methods. Finally, robustness to analytical variability refers to the ability to identify a ﬁnding consistently across variation in methods. The incorporation of these tools and practices will result in more reproducible, replicable, and robust psychological and brain research and a stronger scientiﬁc foundation across ﬁelds of inquiry.},
 annote = {analytical reproducibility = same data same methods should induce same results (what is the nature/scale of the result ?)

robustness to analytical variability: same data, different methods(Jeremy’s topic)},
