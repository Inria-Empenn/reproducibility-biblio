abstract: 'Computational workflows describe the complex multi-step methods that are
  used for data collection, data preparation, analytics, predictive modelling, and
  simulation that lead to new data products. They can inherently contribute to the
  FAIR data principles: by processing data according to established metadata; by creating
  metadata themselves during the processing of data; and by tracking and recording
  data provenance. These properties aid data quality assessment and contribute to
  secondary data usage. Moreover, workflows are digital objects in their own right.
  This paper argues that FAIR principles for workflows need to address their specific
  nature in terms of their composition of executable software steps, their provenance,
  and their development.'
