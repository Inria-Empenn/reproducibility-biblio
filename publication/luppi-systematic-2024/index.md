abstract: Abstract Functional interactions between brain regions can be viewed as
  a network, enabling neuroscientists to investigate brain function through network
  science. Here, we systematically evaluate 768 data-processing pipelines for network
  reconstruction from resting-state functional MRI, evaluating the effect of brain
  parcellation, connectivity definition, and global signal regression. Our criteria
  seek pipelines that minimise motion confounds and spurious test-retest discrepancies
  of network topology, while being sensitive to both inter-subject differences and
  experimental effects of interest. We reveal vast and systematic variability across
  pipelines’ suitability for functional connectomics. Inappropriate choice of data-processing
  pipeline can produce results that are not only misleading, but systematically so,
  with the majority of pipelines failing at least one criterion. However, a set of
  optimal pipelines consistently satisfy all criteria across different datasets, spanning
  minutes, weeks, and months. We provide a full breakdown of each pipeline’s performance
  across criteria and datasets, to inform future best practices in functional connectomics.
